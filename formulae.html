     <h2><u>What is Formula E?</u></h2>
     <img height="auto" width="100%" src="./FE.jpg" alt=“FormulaE”>
     <p>Formula E’s founding mission was for it to race through the streets of the most iconic cities around the world, while having a grid full of the best racing drivers and teams around to show just what sustainable mobility was capable of, driving electric vehicles to the fore in the race for a better, cleaner future. Very good for an idea that started out as nothing more than just notes written on a napkin.</p>
     <p>Formula E made its debut on the grounds of the Olympic Park in Beijing in 2014, and has since grown into a global entertainment brand with motorsport at its heart. Now, with 12 teams with 3 of them been BMW i Andretti Motorsport, Jaguar Racing and  Porsche Formula E Team, and 24 drivers on the grid, the Formula E championship has become a destination for the world's best motorsport teams and racing talent.</p>
     <p>The teams racing in the Formula E championship are Audi sport, BMW Andretti, Dragon Peneske Autosport, DS Automobiles, Virgin Racing, Mercedes EQ, NIO 333 Racing, Nissan e.dams, Jaguar Racing, Tag Heur Porsche and Rokit Venturi.</p>

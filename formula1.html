     <img height="auto" width="100%" src="./mercedes.jpg" alt=“formula1”>
     <p>The name "Formula 1" has no relationship to any specific term, it's a trademarked fantasy name. The name was created to represent the idea that cars were built to a formula, differentiating it from the other series from the time that raced converted road cars..</p>
     <p>Money makes the world go around, and F1 racing is a sport that requires a lot of it. From the cars to the salaries of the drivers, money forms the backbone of the competition. Thus, it makes Formula One ideal for sports betting.</p>

For many ferrari and formula havs simply become inseprable.</p>

     <H3>Who are some of the greatest drivers in Formula 1 History?</H3>
     <p>Lewis Hamiltion-‘Still I Rise’ – these are the words emblazoned across the back of Lewis Hamilton’s helmet and tattooed across his shoulders, and ever since annihilating expectations with one of the greatest rookie performances in F1 history in 2007, that’s literally all he’s done: risen to the top of the all-time pole positions list ahead of his hero Ayrton Senna, surged into second place in the wins column behind only the inimitable Michael Schumacher, and surpassed the legendary Sir Jackie Stewart for the most championship titles by a British driver.</p>
     <img height="auto" width="100%" src="./hamilton.jpg" alt=“Hamilton”>
     <p>Michael Schumacher- The most extraordinary driver's origins were most ordinary. He was born on 3 January, 1969, near Cologne, Germany, six years before his brother Ralf, who would also become a Formula One driver of note. Their father, a bricklayer, ran the local kart track, at Kerpen, where Mrs Schumacher operated the canteen. As a four-year old Michael enjoyed playing on a pedal kart, though when his father fitted it with a small motorcycle engine the future superstar promptly crashed into a lamppost. But Michael quickly mastered his machine and won his first kart championship at six, following which his far from affluent parents arranged sponsorship from wealthy enthusiasts that enabled Michael to make rapid progress. By 1987 he was German and European kart champion and had left school to work as an apprentice car mechanic, a job that was soon replaced by full-time employment as a race driver. In 1990 he won the German F3 championship and was hired by Mercedes to drive sportscars. The next year he made a stunning Formula One debut, qualifying an astonishing seventh in a Jordan for the Belgian Grand Prix at Spa, whereupon he was immediately snapped up by Benetton, with whom in 1992 he won his first F1 race, again at Spa, among the most demanding circuits of them all.</p>

     <p>Alain Prost- His place in Formula One history as one of the sport's greatest drivers is secure, though a career full of conflict and controversy detracted somewhat from his considerable achievements. He won four championships but also left teams acrimoniously on four occasions. He made winning races - 51 times - look easy but was less successful at the politics in which he was invariably embroiled. His bitter feud with Ayrton Senna brought out the best and worst in them both. And yet among the champions only Michael Schumacher, Lewis Hamilton and Juan Manuel Fangio won more crowns than Alain Prost.</p>
     <img height="auto" width="100%" src="./prost.jpg" alt=“Prost”>
     <p>Ayrton Senna- He streaked through the sport like a comet, an other-worldly superstar whose brilliance as a driver was matched by a dazzling intellect and coruscating charisma that illuminated Formula One racing as never before. No one tried harder or pushed himself further, nor did anyone shed so much light on the extremes to which only the greatest drivers go. Intensely introspective and passionate in the extreme, Ayrton Senna endlessly sought to extend his limits, to go faster than himself, a quest that ultimately made him a martyr but did not diminish his mystique.</p>
     <img height="auto" width="100%" src="./senna.jpg" alt=“Senna”>
     <p>Juan Manuel Fangio- Many consider him to be the greatest driver of all time. In seven full Formula One seasons (he missed one recovering from a nearly fatal injury) he was World Champion five times (with four different teams) and runner-up twice. In his 51 championship Grands Prix he started from the front row 48 times (including 29 pole positions) and set 23 fastest race laps en route to 35 podium finishes, 24 of them victories. His superlative track record was achieved by some of the greatest displays of skill and daring ever seen. Fangio did it all with style, grace, nobility and a sense of honour never seen before or since.</p>
     <img height="auto" width="100%" src="./fangio.jpg" alt=“Fangio”>
     <p>Sebastian Vettel-The youngest ever world champion's accumulation of age-related records that began in 2010 continued for four consecutive seasons, culminating in a one-sided 2013 title triumph that confirmed his status as one of the sport’s all-time greats. Sebastian Vettel’s first championship, at the age of 23, provided a surprise ending to an intensely competitive 2010 campaign. There was surely more to come from this fast rising racer, and it came quickly when he completely dominated in 2011 to become the youngest double world champion. In 2012, with a series of comebacks from setbacks against the strongest opposition in the longest ever season, his third driving title in a row was hard-earned and well-deserved. In 2013, and still just 26 years old, he made short work of becoming the youngest ever quadruple world champion.</p>
